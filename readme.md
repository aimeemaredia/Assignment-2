# Question 2 - Overriding Inheritance

## Base File

**Classes**:

    - Base Class 

**Purpose**: To create a `base class` which stores the methods for the variable x and the print method which could be used in other files.

## Classes File

**Classes**:

    - inheriting Class 
    - inClassHam
    - totalInheritance 

**Purpose**: The `inheriting class` inherits the `base class` from the base file and overrrides the variable x. `InClassHam` also inherits from the `base class` and overrides the `printHam` method to say `Ham 2`. The `totalInheritance` class inherits from both `inheritingClass` and `inclassHam` so the user can call instances of one class to run both methods.
